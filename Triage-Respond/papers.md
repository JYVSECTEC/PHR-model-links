* [OASIS Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) for Cyber Security TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cacao) - CACAO TC members are developing a standard to implement the course of action playbook model for cybersecurity operations. In order to defend against cyber threats, organizations must manually identify, create, and document the prevention, mitigation, and remediation steps that, together, form a course of action playbook. However, today, there is is no standardized way to document and share these playbooks across organizational boundaries and technology solutions.
