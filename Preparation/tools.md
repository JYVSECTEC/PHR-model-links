* [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/) - Malware Information Sharing Platform is a threat intelligence platform for gathering, sharing, storing and correlating Indicators of Compromise of targeted attacks, threat intelligence, financial fraud information, vulnerability information or even counter-terrorism information.
* [TheHive](https://thehive-project.org/) - A scalable, open source and free Security Incident Response Platform, tightly integrated with MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform), designed to make life easier for SOCs, CSIRTs, CERTs and any information security practitioner dealing with security incidents that need to be investigated and acted upon swiftly

### AI-enhanced security tools

**Amazon Web Services**

* [Using Amazon GuardDuty to protect your S3 buckets](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-using-amazon-guardduty-to-protect-your-s3-buckets/) - monitors AWS account, workload and data activity in Amazon S3, raises alerts in case suspicious activity is detected.
* [Classifying sensitive data with Amazon Macie](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-enhanced-amazon-macie-now-available/) - Amazon Macie classifies data in S3 buckets either automatically or with user-defined regular expressions.

**Azure / Defender**

* [Defender Advanced Threat Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/microsoft-defender-advanced-threat-protection) - Endpoint detection and reponse, behavioral blocking and containment, automated investigation and response, advanced threat hunting with analytics. 
* [Azure Sentinel, a modern SIEM in the cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-sentinel-general-availability-a-modern-siem-reimagined-in-the-cloud/) - Visualize data with workbooks and apply built-in machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection. Easier threat hunting with collection of hunting queries and Jupyter Notebooks.

**CrowdStrike**

* [CrowdStrike Falcon - Machine Learning scanner](https://go.technicalcommunities.com/webdata/pdf/CrowdStrike-The-Rise-of-Machine-Learning-in-Cybersecurity.pdf) - A part of Falcon endpoint protection, the scanner aims for searching of Indicators of Attack (IoA) instead of the usual Indicators of Compromise (IoC). This aims to provide information about intent and objective of potential attackers, which allows the defenders to prepare before security breaches occur. Falcon also comes with endpoint detection and reponse, threat hunting and threat intelligence tools.

**FireEye**

* [FireEye MalwareGuard](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/products-and-services/2018/07/malwareguard-fireeye-machine-learning-model-to-detect-and-prevent-malware.html) - A part of FireEye's Endpoint Security solution, MalwareGuard aims to prevent execution of zero-day malware that evades signature-based firewalls. 

**Elastic**

* [Elastic Machine Learning](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch-machine-learning) - Perform machine learning on data stored on Elasticsearch, can be integrated with SIEM and logs for detecting anomalies.
