* [Mordor Dataset](https://mordordatasets.com/introduction.html) - Pre-recorded JSON security event files generated by different attacks which can be used for threat hunting training or as datasets for training machine learning models.
* [IDS 2018 Dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2018.html) - A dataset from a large virtual environment where multiple attack scenarios are conducted. The dataset contains network logs, UNIX and Windows system logs. Useful for training anomaly detection models or personnel on threat hunting with an publicly available dataset.
* [VirusShare](https://virusshare.com/) - A large dataset of malware, useful for training or evaluating existing machine learning models that are deployed to detect malicious files. Due to the nature of the dataset, access is granted on invitation, which can be requested by email.
* [theZoo](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo) - An open malware repository, can be used for the same use cases as VirusShare dataset.
* [Windows EVTX Samples](https://github.com/sbousseaden/EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES) - Windows event logs from different types of attacks, mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tactics. Useful for practicing log analysis and threat hunting.
* [Kybermittari](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/fi/palvelumme/tilannekuva-ja-verkostojohtaminen/kybermittari) - Incident management and handling tool for Finnish organizations by NSCS-FI
* [Infection Monkey](https://github.com/guardicore/monkey)- An open-source automated penetration testing tool. The tool utilizes a server to command and visualize the exploitation of vulnerable devices in the network. The tool generates a overview security report, a zero trust report and a list of MITRE ATT&CK techniques used.
