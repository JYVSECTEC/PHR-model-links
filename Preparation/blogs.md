* [Collecting and curating IoC whitelists for threat intelligence and machine learning](https://medium.com/@jason_trost/collecting-and-curating-ioc-whitelists-for-threat-intelligence-and-machine-learning-research-c5f435431d3e) - Malicious programs may use popular domains and DNS servers for connection checking and address lookups, which can lead to open-source threat intelligence classifying them malicious by accident. The blog contains a number of ways to expand your whitelists to prevent blocking beningn domains.
* [Data Analysis for Cyber Security 101](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-analysis-for-cybersecurity-101-detecting-data-exfiltration-ae887594f675) - A blog series with two posts at the time of writing. In the first post, network traffic visualization methods to detect data exfiltration in a CTF challenge are explored. The second post highlights different methods for lateral movement detection, such as dark space and honey things.
* [Machine Learning Methods for Malware Detection](https://media.kaspersky.com/en/enterprise-security/Kaspersky-Lab-Whitepaper-Machine-Learning.pdf) - Whitepaper by Kaspersky Lab which explains requirements, process of creating and applications of a machine learning malware detection system.
* [Detecting Obfuscated PowerShell using Machine Learning](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/11/obfuscated-command-line-detection-using-machine-learning.html) - A blog by FireEye, where a random forest and a neural network model are trained to detect obfuscated PowerShell scripts generated by Invoke-Obfuscation tool.
* [EPP, EDR, MDR & XDR: What’s the Difference? And How Should We Think About Endpoint Security?](https://medium.com/technology-hits/epp-edr-mdr-xdr-whats-the-difference-f2d58db3985d) - Along with promoting Zero Trust Architecture for cybersecurity, I see more and more discussion about EDR, MDR, and XDR. But before going into details about the pros and cons, I want to set the common field and introduce the basics about their differences.
