* [GRR Rapid Response](https://github.com/google/grr) - Google's open source, agent-based Incident Response framework for remote live detection and response written in Python programming language
* [KAPE (Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor)](https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/kroll-artifact-parser-extractor-kape) - KAPE is a multi-function program that primarily: collects files and processes collected files with one or more programs. KAPE reads configuration files on the fly and based on their contents, collects and processes relevant files. This makes KAPE very extensible in that the programâ€™s author does not need to be involved to add or expand functionality.
