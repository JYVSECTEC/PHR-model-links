* [The Unified Kill Chain - RAISING RESILIENCE AGAINST ADVANCED CYBER ATTACKS
 ](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain.pdf) - Research shows that the traditional Cyber Kill Chain® (CKC), as presented by researchers of Lockheed Martin, is perimeter- and malware-focused. As such, the traditional model fails to cover other attack vectors and attacks that occur behind the organizational perimeter. The Unified Kill Chain offers significant improvements over these scope limitations of the CKC and the time-agnostic nature of the tactics in MITRE’s ATT&CKTM model (ATT&CK)

All dates shown in the cards are the dates when the stated activities started, not necessarily when the reports about them came out
