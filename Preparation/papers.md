* [An AI-based, Multi-stage detection system of banking botnets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.08276.pdf) - JPMorgan Chase engineers propose a "Cyber Data Lake", where data feeds from new domain registrations, benign and malicious domains, known domain fuzzing permutations, internal logs and threat intelligence are combined into a central platform using Big Data tools such as Hadoop and Spark. Deep learning models are trained using features from the platform and provide lexical models and anomaly detection to detect spearphishing and data exfiltration.
